# Working with Arrays

The source and tests in this directory correspond to the exercises given at the end of chapter 2 of _Data Structures & Algorithms with JavaScript_.
These include classes and methods for working with 1 and 2-dimensional arrays, and some common array methods.

## Running the Tests

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is my test suite of choice for this project, as it includes a great set of assertion methods out-of-the-box, and is terse enough to keep even a long test suite's output readable and directive.

To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have Jasmine installed. `$ npm i -g jasmine`
2. Run `$ jasmine arrays.spec.js`
