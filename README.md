# Data Structures & Algorithms with JavaScript

This repo contains notes and test exercises I've come up with during a readthrough of the book, [_Data Structures & Algorithms with JavaScript_](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-JavaScript-approaches/dp/1449364934).

I highly recommend the book to anyone who, like me, has entered the web development field without any formal computer science education. This book is a huge help for improving your problem solving, critical thinking, and programming skills. In short, this book is great for the skilled _web developer_ who wants to become a better _software engineer_.
